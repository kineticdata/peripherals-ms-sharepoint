== Sharepoint List Item Add
Creates an item for a given list in SharePoint using the REST API.

=== Parameters
[List Name]
  The name of the list that the item will be added to.
[Item (JSON)]
  A JSON representation of the item that should be created.

=== Results
[Id]
  Id of the newly created list item

==== Sample Configuration
List Name:              Sample List
Item (JSON):             {"Title": "Sample Title", "Random Number": 15, "Random Date": "2017-12-22"}

=== Detailed Description
This handler creates an item for a given Sharepoint list using the REST API and basic authentication.
The item to be created is passed as a JSON string, where the keys are the list item labels (Title,
Due Date, etc) and the values are the values to place in those columns when the item is created.
The field keys for a list can also be found by using Sharepoint List Items Retrieve to get an
already created item, which can then be used to determine which keys match up with what columns.
Any errors that happen during the call are caught and re-raised and the handler will return the Id
of the new item after the end of a successful call.
